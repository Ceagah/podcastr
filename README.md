## Installing

After you download this repo, you can run :

`Npm install`

This will install the dependences at the package.json archive.
When it install all dependences, you neeed to run :

`npm start`

or

`yarn start `

Note : <strong> I (CARLOS) </strong>, recomend yarn , the package menager from facebook dev. It install the packages a little faster, and run better than npm.
